# Pandoc Configuration Files #
This is my "live" Pandoc data directory contents (default location: `$HOME/.local/share/pandoc/` on macOS and Linux). Many of these files are referenced using [`pandocomatic`](https://github.com/htdebeer/pandocomatic) via my [`pandocomatic.yaml`](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/blob/master/pandocomatic.yaml) configuration. Pandocomatic automates using pandoc settings, so you simply assign one or more "recipes" in your document metadata (docx-refs, latex-letter etc.) and the correct Pandoc settings are used for you.

I generally use this triggered via Scrivener's post-processing compile feature; see [Scrivomatic](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic) for more details of this workflow. My templates and filters are customised: I've collected and modified several [Pandoc templates](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/tree/master/templates) and use a [set of filters to transform Academic metadata](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/tree/master/filters) to multiple outputs; my filters are written in Ruby using [https://github.com/htdebeer/paru](Paru). 
This is my "live" Pandoc data directory contents (default location: `$HOME/.local/share/pandoc/` on macOS and Linux). I usually use [`pandocomatic`](https://github.com/htdebeer/pandocomatic) to manage Pandoc via my [`pandocomatic.yaml`](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/blob/master/pandocomatic.yaml) configuration file. Pandocomatic automates all Pandoc settings, so you simply assign one or more "recipes" in your document metadata (docx-refs, latex-letter etc.) and the correct Pandoc settings are used for you. Pandocomatic can also run pre– and post–processing scripts to help with tweaks Pandoc may not be able to implement directly. Some of my pandocomatic recipes are also available as [defaults files](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#defaults-files) callable directly using `pandoc -d`.

Most of my writing is academic in nature. I generally use my pandocomatic recipes triggered automagically via Scrivener's post-processing compile feature; see [Scrivomatic](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic) for more details of the workflow.

I have my own personal choice of fonts, you should change the font metadata to those you have on your computer.
