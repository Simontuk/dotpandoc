In this review, we discuss time-resolved X-ray diffraction on small molecules and proteins with particular emphasis on its application to crystalline (crystallography) and liquid-solution (liquidography) samples. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction has been used to study picosecond and slower dynamics at synchrotrons and can now access even femtosecond dynamics with the recent arrival of X-ray free-electron lasers.}, location = {Department of Chemistry, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 305-701, South Korea; email: kihosung@kaist.ac.kr, wky3219@kaist.ac.kr, hyotcherl.ihee@kaist.ac.kr.

One motivation for the development of such X-ray sources was the proposal to obtain structures of macromolecules, macromolecular complexes, and virus particles, without the need for crystallization, through diffraction measurements of single noncrystalline objects. Initial explorations of this idea and of outrunning radiation damage with femtosecond pulses led to the development of serial crystallography and the ability to obtain high-resolution structures of small crystals without the need for cryogenic cooling. This technique allows the understanding of conformational dynamics and enzymatics and the resolution of intermediate states in reactions over timescales of 100 fs to minutes. The promise of more photons per atom recorded in a diffraction pattern than electrons per atom contributing to an electron micrograph may enable diffraction measurements of single molecules, although challenges remain.}, location = {Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, DESY, 22607 Hamburg, Germany; email: henry.chapman@desy.de.
